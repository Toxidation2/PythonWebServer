# PythonWebServer
## About

A web server made in Python

## Installation instructions

Just run main.py and go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser of choice and you should see a example home page! You can now replace the index.py file with your own home page of choice. (note that I would not recommend using this for public use, private use is fine, as there is probably major insecurities, so use this at your own risk if you're gonna use it for public use)

## Live demonstration

Here is a live demonstration of PythonWebServer. This is the default install so it displays the example home page mentioned above. Want to set it up on your own? See above!
